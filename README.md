# Projects from the Course DCA1202 - Advanced Programming

This repository contains the projects developed during the course DCA1202 - Advanced Programming, taught by Professor Dr. Adelardo Adelino Dantas de Medeiros at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) in the semester 2023.2. All projects were implemented based on specifications provided by the professor.

It's important to note that, in many cases, the professor provided various implementations as starting points for the projects. Therefore, not all the code provided in this repository was exclusively authored by me.

The projects are organized in separate folders within this repository. Each folder represents a specific project developed throughout the course.

Order of projects:
1. Poly
2. Maze
3. StoreStock
4. digital-circuit-simulator
5. WhatsProg
